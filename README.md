# Todo React WebApp

Created an Todo app for users to track their daily todos. The app will allow user's to enter Todos. The user can mark the todo completed and can also delete it. User has an option to filter out todos according to their status that is completed or uncompleted.

Used React Hooks, Google's Material UI and LocalStorage for storing the todos.
